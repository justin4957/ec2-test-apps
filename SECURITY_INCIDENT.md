# Security Incident Report

## Date: October 30, 2025

## Summary
API keys and credentials were accidentally committed to git history in the file `location-tracker/deploy-fix-errorlogs.sh`.

## Exposed Credentials

### Commit: 5c6079bd7eba13b364cbbe774c4222081ee3fead
**File**: `location-tracker/deploy-fix-errorlogs.sh` (now removed from history)

1. **Giphy API Key**: `ORUVKLvwng***************` (redacted - already rotated)
2. **OpenAI API Key**: `sk-proj-rer99x7***...***` (redacted - already rotated)
3. **Tracker Password**: `SecureTracker***!` (redacted - already changed)

## Remediation Actions Completed

1. ✅ Used `git filter-branch` to remove the file containing secrets from entire git history
2. ✅ Cleaned up git references and ran aggressive garbage collection
3. ✅ Verified secrets are no longer in git history
4. ✅ Updated local `.env.ec2` file with placeholder values
5. ✅ Added security warnings in `.env.ec2` file

## Required Actions (URGENT)

### 1. Rotate API Keys IMMEDIATELY

**Giphy API Key:**
- Go to https://developers.giphy.com/dashboard/
- Delete the old API key (exposed key has been redacted from this document)
- Generate a new API key
- Update `.env.ec2` with the new key
- ✅ COMPLETED: Keys have been rotated

**OpenAI API Key:**
- Go to https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
- Revoke/delete the old key (exposed key has been redacted from this document)
- Generate a new API key
- Update `.env.ec2` with the new key
- ✅ COMPLETED: Keys have been rotated

**Tracker Password:**
- Choose a new strong password
- Update `.env.ec2` with the new password
- Update any deployed instances

### 2. Force Push Cleaned History

⚠️ **WARNING**: This will rewrite git history. Coordinate with all team members.

```bash
git push origin --force --all
git push origin --force --tags
```

### 3. Monitor for Unauthorized Usage

- Check OpenAI usage dashboard for any unexpected API calls
- Check Giphy API usage for any unusual activity
- Review any bills or usage reports for anomalies

### 4. Notify Team

If this repository has collaborators, notify them that:
- Git history has been rewritten
- They need to re-clone the repository or rebase their branches
- Old API keys have been compromised

## Prevention Measures Added

1. ✅ `.env.ec2` already in `.gitignore`
2. ✅ Enhanced `.gitignore` with deployment script patterns
3. ✅ Security warnings added to environment files

## Lessons Learned

1. Never hardcode credentials in scripts, even deployment scripts
2. Always use environment variables or secret management tools
3. Review files before committing to ensure no secrets are included
4. Consider using git hooks or secret scanning tools (e.g., `gitleaks`, `trufflehog`)
